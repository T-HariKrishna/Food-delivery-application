Food Delivery Application

I developed a Food Delivery Application as a full-stack Java web project that simulates a real-world online food ordering system. The main objective was to understand clean architecture, authentication flows, and role-based access control.

The application includes a user authentication system with registration and login functionality. I implemented a Forgot Password feature with OTP-based verification, where the OTP is automatically generated by the application logic and validated internally. This OTP mechanism is implemented without using external servers, email services, or SMS APIs. The focus was on understanding the OTP generation, validation flow, and expiry logic rather than third-party integrations.

After successful login, users can search for restaurants, view restaurant menus, browse food items, and place orders easily.

The application also contains an Admin module with role-based access control. The admin can add, update, and delete restaurant details and manage food items, including modifying food names, prices, categories, and availability.

Architecturally, the project follows the MVC pattern along with the DAO (Data Access Object) model:

Servlets act as controllers and handle request processing and validations

DAO classes manage all database interactions such as user login, password reset, restaurant management, and food item CRUD operations

Model classes represent entities like User, Restaurant, FoodItem, Order, and OTP

I used JDBC with MySQL for database connectivity, HTML and CSS for the frontend, and Maven for project management. The project was developed using Eclipse IDE.

Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of DAO-based architecture, authentication logic, OTP workflows, and building a real-world Java full-stack application.
